# The Gaming Room Client

**Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?**
The Gaming Room is a client looking to take their Android game application, "Draw It or Lose It," and make it available on multiple platforms. The game involves teams guessing what is being drawn from a library of stock images. The client required a web-based version that supports multiple teams and players, with unique game and team names, running on a distributed environment.

**What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**
I assessed and documented the characteristics, benefits, and shortcomings of diverse operating platforms (Linux, Mac, Windows, and mobile). This holistic analysis provided tailored recommendations that enabled well-informed and thoughtful decisions based on the client’s needs.

**What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?**
Reviewing the design document helped in planning the development process. It reduced the ambiguity of requirements, constraints, and architectural decisions, leading to a more structured and efficient coding phase.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**
One thing to revise in the work: The work on security measures could be explained in more depth. Including more concrete examples of security measures  would also enhance the comprehensiveness and practicality of this document.

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**
I made things work by implementing their desires for scalability, performance, and security. Armed with this information, you can ensure the software is functional, user-friendly, and meets client expectations. Such a result-oriented approach to customer satisfaction has kept us continuously sailing upstream.

**How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?**
My strategy was to analyze the requirements thoroughly and then choose design patterns accordingly (e.g., Singleton, Iterator) while always considering scalability and maintainability. In the future, this would involve using well-constructed design documents, maintaining regular client feedback loops, and embracing agile methodologies to ensure we can adapt our approach over time
